## ✨ Features

- 📤 Browse and upload an image using a GUI.
- 🔐 Encrypt image pixels using a Caesar cipher shift key.
- 🔓 Decrypt the encrypted image back to its original state.
- 🔁 Swap pixels to distort and create unique image patterns.
- 🧑‍💻 User-friendly interface built using **Tkinter**.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Pixel-Manipulator.git
   cd Image-Pixel-Manipulator
    ```
## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Use the "Browse Image" button to upload your image from your file system.

3. Enter a numeric shift key value (e.g., 25) in the input field provided.

4. Click one of the following buttons to perform actions:

5> 🔐 Encrypt – to apply a Caesar cipher-like pixel value shift encryption.

6. 🔓 Decrypt – to reverse the pixel shift and retrieve the original image.

7. 🔃 Pixel Swap – to swap pixel positions for distortion encryption.

8. The modified/encrypted/decrypted image will be saved in your current project directory as:

- encrypted_image1.jpg

- decrypted_image1.jpg

- encrypted_swap.jpg

You can now open these saved images to see the results! 🖼️🎯
